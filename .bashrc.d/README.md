All scripts execute in sequential asciibetical order.

The root of this directory contains pure shell scripts, used for aliasing, variable defining, function defining and more.

For ordering, one can name files in a sequential order (i.e. 00 01 02 ... 53 ... etc...) however it is entirly optional.

This system implements command hooking for running commands pre and post execution,
refer to [README](hooks/README.md) for more information.
